# Set up service client SDK's
{: #push_step_3}

Ensure that you [obtain notification service provider credentials](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-push_step_1) and have [configured a push service instance](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-push_step_2). You then need to set up the application for using {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service to register, subscribe, and receive push notifications. 

To set up the service client SDK, go through the following steps based on your application type.

## On Android applications
{: #push_step_3_Android}

You can enable Android applications to receive push notifications to your devices. Android Studio is a prerequisite and is the recommended method to build Android projects. Basic knowledge of Android Studio is essential.

Ensure that you have gone through [Obtain notification service provider credentials](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-push_step_1) to set up the FCM project and obtain your credentials.

Complete the steps for [{{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Android SDK](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-android-push/tree/master) to enable Android apps to receive push notifications sent from the service. 

1. Follow this [documentation](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-android-push/tree/master#installation) to install SDK for your Android app.

1. Open the app in Android Studio. Copy the `google-services.json` file that you have created through [Obtain your credentials](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-push_step_1) to your Android application module root directory. Note that the `google-service.json` file includes the added package names.

1. [Initialize core SDK and Push SDK](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-android-push/tree/master#include-core-sdk-and-push-sdk).
   - Initialize core SDK with IBM Cloud application region in your app Main Activity file. If you don't have an app, get a [sample app](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-samples-android-hellopush/) to test it out.

      ![Editing Main activity file](images/mp-gradle-main-activity.png "Editing the main activity file with IBM cloud application region")

   - Initialize Push SDK by copying APP GUID and CLIENT SECRET from **Service credentials** page for the Push Notification service on IBM Cloud.

      ![App GUID and Client secret](images/mp-appguid.png "Editing the main activity file with APP GUID and client secret")

      Paste the APP GUID and CLIENT SECRET under your appâ€™s Main Activity file.

      ![Editing Main activity file](images/mp-gradle-main-activity1.png "Editing the main activity file with APP GUID and client secret")

1. If you have an android device, connect to your mac/windows and select the device in the Android studio.
1. Click the run button. If you don't have an android device, [create an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) with API 28 or higher.
1. Run the app and click Register device button that appears on your app for the push notifications.

Your next step is to [Send a notification](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-push_step_4).

## On Cordova applications
{: #push_step_3_Cordova}

Cordova is a platform for building hybrid applications with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service supports development of Cordova-based iOS and Android applications.

To enable Cordova applications to receive, push notifications to your devices, you need to configure the [Cordova plug-in Push SDK](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-cordova-plugin-push/tree/master#ios-app).

After setting up the Cordova plug-in Push SDK, the next step is to [Send a notification](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-push_step_4).

## On iOS applications
{: #push_step_3_iOS}

To enable iOS applications to receive {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} to your devices, you need to configure the [iOS SDK for Push Notifications service](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-swift-push/tree/master#setup-client-application). 

After setting up the iOS SDK, your next step is to [Send a notification](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-push_step_4).

## On Web browsers
{: #push_step_3_web}

To enable your browser applications to receive, push notifications, you need to configure the [Web SDK for Push Notifications service](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-javascript-webpush/blob/master/README.md).

After setting up the Web SDK, your next step is to [Send a notification](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-push_step_4).
