{: #compliance}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Service provides a trustworthy and secure way to send notifications to the registered mobile devices.
{: shortdesc}

## HIPAA
{: #hipaa}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Service meets the required {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Controls that are commensurate with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Security and Privacy Rule requirements. The {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Service stores the data in encrypted format at rest, and transmits the data encrypted.

If you want to send HIPAA regulated information by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Service that you should not be using Post/message API, since the payload sent over third-party Push providers might not meet regulatory guidelines. Instead, you can use the following steps where only messageId is sent over third-party Push providers, but the actual sensitive data is downloaded by the client application over a secure (https) transport.

1. Provision a new instance.
1. Send a [silent notification](/docs/mobilepush?topic=mobilepush-interactive-notifications#send_silent_notifications_for_ios) by using the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Service.
1. The {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Service sends the notification by using the push cloud providers like FCM, APNS. By the characteristics of the silent notification alert are not sent as part of the notification.
1. Once the device receives notification with the ``message id`` / ``nid`` transmitted, application makes a call to the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Service to receive the notification alert by using the ``GET /message/{messageId}``.

This helps in achieving transmission of sensitive text content over a secured channel by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} Service.

IBM doesn't have Business Associate Agreements (BAA) relation with APNS/FCM.
